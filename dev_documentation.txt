Time: [Current Time]

### DEPLOYMENT AUTOMATION REMOVED

#### Changes Made
- **Removed GitHub Actions Workflow**: Deleted `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- **Removed Deployment Directory**: Cleaned up `.github/workflows/` and `.github/` directories
- **Disabled Auto-Deployment**: Portfolio no longer automatically deploys to GitHub Pages on push

## CONCLUSION
Successfully transformed a complex, animation-heavy portfolio into a clean, minimal, and professional presentation that prioritizes content and usability over visual effects. The addition of the single-page expandable layout further improves user experience by providing instant overview with progressive disclosure of details. The removal of automated GitHub deployment provides manual control over releases. The new design aligns with modern minimalist trends while maintaining full functionality and improving performance across all metrics.
